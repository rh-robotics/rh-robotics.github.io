title: The Monochromats
---

We are the Monochromats, FTC Team 16748. We were established in 2019 by Rowland Hall St. Marks School, in Salt Lake City. As the first FTC team for Rowland Hall, we quickly made a name for ourselves and our school. In 2021, Rowland Hall created our sister team, the Iron Lions (FTC 19922). Together we have made Rowland Hall's Robotics program a force to be reckoned with.

One of the most important aspects of the Monocromats is our Outreach. We spend the bulk of our time, connecting with our community, whether that is daily social media posts, or volunteering at FRC (First Robotic Challenge) competitions. 

Our team in the Center Stage season comprises mostly of freshmen, with a mix of juniors and seniors. Because of this massive influx of freshmen, we implemented a program where an upperclassman would "Adopt" a freshman to show the ropes and mentor them through their rookie year.
