The Robotics team at Rowland Hall in Salt Lake City has expanded and developed since being
established. The Monochromats, 16748, were formed in 2019 as an FTC team after having been an
independant club since 2013. This was due to the fact that the robotics interest at the school
had been expanding, and an interest in competing in FTC began to develop among the existing
members.

In the 2021 season, so many new members joined the team that the Iron Lions, 19922, were created,
an almost entirely freshman team. This was a moment of immense progress for the Rowbotics team. Our
goal has always been to promote STEM interest throughout the Salt Lake area and connect with local
tech communities. We believe that once we reach the student body at our school, we can outreach to
larger areas and inspire more people.

As our teams have developed through the years, we have done our best to encourage diversity
throughout both. We continue to have several members that represent religious, LGBTQIA+/GRSM,
and racial diversities, and are actively attempting to encourage a diverse population of students
to join our team.

The Monochromats, or 16748, was formed in 2019 after an interest in competing in FTC was voiced. The
founding members either since moved to 19922 or left the school, and as such 16748 is currently composed
of freshman and juniors. [See more](/16748.html).
